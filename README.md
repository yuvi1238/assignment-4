In Assignment 4 , we have two projects:

(1) Read a File and Handle Errors :

this code will take file name as input and it will print its data line by line. 
if the file doesn't exists, then it will show that the file is not found. here we will open the file with "r mode" . if the file doesn't exist then it will go in expect and it will show
FileNotFoundError and will print , that the file doesn't exist.

(2)  Write and Append Data to a File :
tthis code will take input from user and will save it in output .txt , first the code will ask user for some input , and then it will ask to append some data to store ,
and then it will save the input data in the file. and if the file doesn't exists then it will create the file and then it will save the data.
